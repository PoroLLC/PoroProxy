**First**, Open each installation file. (NODJS AND DISCORDJS)

**Then**, Open the bots folder and start editing the token in config.json, config2.json, and config3.json.

**Then**, Start your bot with the startup files. (SUB-BOTS WILL APPEAR OFFLINE, THAT MEANS THEY ARE WORKING!)

**Then**, Edit the code in code.js, and code2.js.

**Last but not least**, Have fun!
